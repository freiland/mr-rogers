It returns a list of numbers from zero to the user input integer, but any number with 3 is replaced by the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?", any number with a 2 is replaced by "Beep!", and anu number with a 1 is replaced by "Boop!". The rules are listed in order, meaning that the "3 rule" will overrule any of the previous rules, and the "2 rule" will overrule the last rule.
